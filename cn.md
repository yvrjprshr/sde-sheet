## What do you mean by Network?
Set of devices connected to each other over the physical medium is known as a computer network. For example the Internet.


## What do you mean by Node?
In the computer network, the node is known as a device.


## What do you mean by Network Topology?
A network topology is a physical structure of the network which defines how the computers or node will be connected to each other.


## What is Routers?
A router is a device which is responsible for sending data from source to destination over the computer network.


## What is the OSI model?
OSI model stands for Open System Interconnection. It’s a reference model which describes that how different applications will communicate to each other over the computer network.


## Explain the Different layers of the OSI model.
The different layers of the OSI model are given below:

Physical Layer:	Converts data bit into an electrical impulse.
Datalink Layer:	Data packet will be encoded and decoded into bits.
Network Layer:	Transfer of datagrams from one to another.
Transport Layer:	Responsible for Data transfer from one to another.
Session Layer:	Manage and control signals between computers.
Presentation Layer:	Transform data into application layer format.
Application Layer:	An end user will interact with the Application layer.


## Describe Hub, Switch and Router?
Hub: Hub will broadcast all data to every port. It has a common connection point for all devices.
Switch: Switch will create the dynamic connection and provide information to the requesting port.
Router: Router is the devices which will be responsible for forwarding data packets.


## What do you mean by the TCP/IP Model?
TCP/IP stands for Transmission control protocol and Internet protocol. It describes how the data will get transmitted and routed from end to end communication.


## Explain the different Layers of TCP/IP Model.
Application Layer, Transport Layer, Network or Internet Layer, Network interface layer.


## What do you mean by HTTP?
HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and the port for this is 80. This protocol is responsible for web content.


## What do you mean by TCP and UDP?
TCP stands for Transfer control protocol and UDP stands for User Datagrams protocol and TCP is a connection-oriented protocol and UDP is a Connectionless protocol.


## What do you mean by a Firewall?
Firewall is a concept of a security system that will helps computers to protect it with unauthorized access or any cyber-attack.


## What do you mean by DNS?
DNS Stands for Domain Name System. It’s an internet address mapping process with the local name. We can also call it as an internet phonebook.


## What do you mean by Proxy server?
Proxy server prevents the external users which are unauthorized to access the network.


## What do you mean by Classes of Network?
The Classes of IPV4 are of 5 types:

Class A	0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
Class B	128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
Class C	192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
Class D	224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
Class E	240.0.0.0 to 247.255.255.255


## What do you mean by NIC?
NIC stands for Network interface card. It is an adapter that will be installed on the computer and because of that NIC, only that computer will interact with the network.


## What do you mean by ASCII?
ASCII is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.


## What are the types of mode available in Network?
Data transferring mode in a computer network will be of three types:
Simplex, Half-Duplex and Full Duplex.


## What do you mean by SLIP protocol?
SLIP stands for Serial Line Interface Protocol. It is used for sending IP datagram over a network in a single line.


## What are the key elements of the protocol?
There are three key elements of the protocol:

Syntax: Describe the format of the data.
Semantics: Describes the meaning of each section.
Timings: Explain the timing that how fast the data can be sent.


## What do you mean by Decoder?
A decoder is a program which converts the encrypted data into its actual format.
